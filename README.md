Assignments from my Data Structures Using Java Course

### Notes:

We are *required* to use Netbeans, and I no longer have the will to fight the silly headers Netbeans puts in every file.  Sorry.

These assignments contain questionable logic.  I did not write the assignments.

### Why is there no Lab 9?
I have no idea.  We never did one.

### What grade did you get?
100% - I did not miss a single point on any assignment.
